## Blog Generator with LangGraph and Streamlit
A Python application that generates blog posts using an agentic AI workflow powered by LangGraph, Grok (via ChatGroq), Tavily search, and Streamlit for the UI. Users can input a topic, generate a blog, and refine it with feedback, with a visual workflow graph displayed for clarity.

## Features
Agentic Workflow: Three nodes (research, write, feedback) collaborate to create and refine blog content.

## Web Search: Uses Tavily to fetch relevant information for the blog topic.
## AI Generation: Leverages Grok (Mixtral model) for writing and refining blog posts.
## Interactive UI: Streamlit interface for topic input, blog generation, and feedback submission.
## Workflow Visualization: Displays a graph of the LangGraph workflow as a flowchart.

## Prerequisites
Python: 3.8 or higher.
